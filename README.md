# Joystick

Simple wrapper around the Linux Joystick API.
*ONLY WORKS ON LINUX AT THE MOMENT*
the docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/joystick](https://hexdocs.pm/joystick).

Created by Connor Ribgy. Transferred here after project was archived for a long while, if only to keep dependencies current.

## Installation

[available in Hex](https://hex.pm/packages/joystick), the package can be installed
by adding `joystick` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:joystick, "~> 0.2.2"}
  ]
end
```

## TODO
* Support OSX.
* Support button maps.
